<B>Bangtan Sonyeondan</B> (also known as <B>"BTS"</B> or <B>"Bangtan"</B>) is a 7 member South Korean Hip-Hop group under BigHit Entertainment. The name "Bangtan Sonyeondan" is Korean for "Bulletproof boys/boy scouts". The meaning of the name is that they wanted to protect against the prejudice about teens in their 10's and 20's. It's very cheesy, and they were embarrassed about it before, but now they've come to love and be proud of it. Bangtan debuted on June 13, 2013 with the songs <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUkViXyQTI4" TARGET="_blank">"No More Dreams"</A> and <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE9lkSdtZeQ" TARGET="_blank">"We Are Bulletproof Pt.2".</A> They are known all around the world for their strong music, impressive dance moves and genuine members.

They currently have 6 albums, 5 mini albums and 1 full album. When they first debuted, they got a lot of attention because of their genre of music, which was based strongly on old school hip-hop. They also gained a lot of attention through their meaningful and personal lyrics, as well as their powerful dancing and "bad boy" image like their music videos <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8MfJg68oCs" TARGET="_blank">"Boy in Luv"</A>, <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bagj78IQ3l0" TARGET="_blank">"Danger"</A>, and <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQmpVHUi-0A" TARGET="_blank">"War of Hormone"</A>. Their music style was considered "manly" and "tough" and to the point, but by early 2015, they changed things up a bit. 
<P>
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjskoRh8GTE" TARGET="_blank">"I Need U"</A> is the first single that they got number one for, and it caused them a huge spike in popularity. They were known internationally before, but after it was released, they became worldwide. The album that was released with the song is called "The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 1" and it was completely different from any albums they released before. It is easier to listen to because it is less rough but it still contains the deep and meaningful lyrics that BTS started with. "I Need U" is a single that has a deep story line in the music video that over all represents the theme "happiness within sadness". The meaning of the music video has been left for the fans to interpret and to understand, which had led to many theories that lead to some not knowing what to believe. This video (and album) also happens to be the first part of a series.
<P>
The second part is called, unsurprisingly, "The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2". This mini album is similar to the first one in genre but the theme has changed from "happiness within sadness" to "sadness within happiness". The single for this album is called <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wn85Ge22FQ" TARGET="_blank">"Run"</A> and it completely changed everyone's point of view on the first video. This video also gained them lots of popularity and it also won them number one.

BTS then became even more known for their detailed concepts and eye-catching dancing. Even though there were no HD recorded dances in "I Need U" or "Run" like in their previous videos, their choreographies still caught many people's attention. "I Need U's" <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvUZb9NT7EY" TARGET="_blank">body wave choreography </A>and "Run's" <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S3ZhJGv8JM" TARGET="_blank">jacket choreography</A> were recognized by many people. Their most impressive choreography, I think, is <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVwAVbKYYeM" TARGET="_blank">"Dope"</A>. It has many fast and sharp movements which reminds people of Bangtan's capabilities. Bangtan are also the first artists in while to produce such difficult and visually appealing choreographies. Another impressive choreography was their debut song, No More Dreams. The sharp dance moves and the unique move at the end is very appealing and leaves the viewer saying "wow". Overall, BTS have very strong, unique and eye-catching dance and song style that brings in many fans.
